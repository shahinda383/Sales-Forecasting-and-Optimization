# 🌟 MLOps – Sales Forecasting Project

Welcome to the **MLOps module** of our Sales Forecasting Project – a meticulously crafted pipeline designed for **robust, scalable, and production-ready machine learning workflows**.  

This folder encapsulates the essence of modern MLOps practices, integrating **experiment tracking, containerization, deployment, CI/CD, web applications, monitoring, and model drift detection**. Every component is engineered to ensure **reproducibility, reliability, and scalability**.

## 🔹 Core Workflow

The MLOps pipeline follows a **seamless lifecycle** from data ingestion to actionable insights:

1. **Experiment Tracking**
   - Every model, parameter, and metric is meticulously logged using **MLflow**.
   - Enables reproducibility and detailed performance comparison across multiple experiments.

2. **Containerization**
   - Code and dependencies are encapsulated in **Docker containers**, ensuring consistent execution across environments.
   - Facilitates easy deployment, testing, and scaling.

3. **API & Web Application**
   - **FastAPI** provides a lightweight, high-performance REST API for predictions.
   - **Streamlit Web App** offers a user-friendly interface, allowing CSV uploads and visual dashboards for forecasting insights.

4. **Continuous Integration & Deployment**
   - **GitHub Actions** automate the CI/CD pipeline.
   - Every push triggers testing, validation, and automated deployment, ensuring code integrity and operational readiness.

5. **Monitoring & Model Drift Detection**
   - Real-time monitoring dashboards implemented using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.
   - Model performance and drift are continuously evaluated with **Evidently AI**, enabling proactive alerts and maintenance.

6. **Scaling & Orchestration**
   - Containerized services are orchestrated with **Kubernetes**, prepared to handle high concurrency and production-level traffic.
   - Ensures the system remains resilient and responsive under load.
