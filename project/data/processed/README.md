# Processed Data – Cleaned & Merged

This folder contains datasets generated by the project's *cleaning and merging pipeline*:

- Raw datasets are cleaned (missing values handled, types corrected, irrelevant rows removed).
- Multiple sources are merged into unified tables.
- Columns standardized across datasets: Store, Dept, Date, Weekly_Sales, Weather, Trends, Holiday, Macro, Fuel, Competitor, Sentiment.

> *Note:* Processed datasets are *not uploaded* to GitHub. They are generated automatically when running the pipeline.

*Storage & Usage:*  
- Generated as CSV or Parquet files in data/processed/.
- Automatically read by downstream pipelines: feature engineering, modeling, and deployment.
